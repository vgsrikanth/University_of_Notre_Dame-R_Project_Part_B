# University of Notre_Dame-R Project_Part B
Part B of the R project done as part of course work at University of Notre Dame M.S Data Science degree

Instructions
In Part A, I prepared the physical characteristic of data. For Part B, I combined the physical characteristic of data with tables provided for income and education data. Standardized table of physical characteristics is provided.

The variable for education records the highest grade achieved by the given year.  Income reports the salary and wages for the given year. You can read more about this dataset directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics here (Links to an external site = https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm).

For Project Part B,I investigated how the other variables affect income using EDA(exploratory data analysis), and grouped summaries. I analyzed salary changes over single and over several years.The goal is to generate hypotheses from supporting plots and data concerning the effect of these variables on income.
